i was walking by the street
smiling at my feet
birds sang, sun shined 
and thats when she came into my life

heart has left chat
tongue followed him
awkardness sneaked by slowly
but thankfully she said
i have a boyfriend

mom said i was bad at pretending
and tats why i started listening
poor girl,she never stood a chance
and off i go giving one last glance
