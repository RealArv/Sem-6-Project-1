a. use 2 microphones or one guitar pickup and one microphone
   1. keep the 2 microphones at equal distances
b. EQ - 1. use high pass at the lower freq to remove bacground noise(from cars etc..) anything below 50 (usually)
        2. use freq between 2.5 - 4 khz to improve clarity of the guitar(make it sound more bright). scroll left to right to see which one sounds good
        3. above 11-12 khz listen and see whether eq is needed or not(more clarity or not), sometimes it can sound ear piercing or sharp.  
	4. sometimes acoustic guitar can be boxy.. it can be sound between 200-500 hz
           note: use broader curves when improving sound and narrow curves when removing. will make the guitar sound more natural

c. use compression
d. use bridge sound for the right speaker(Right ear) and neck sound for the left speaker(L ear)
e. reverb
d. reverb secret technique(see once more)
